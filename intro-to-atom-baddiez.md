### Coffeeing a Desk
If you see a set composed of coffee, sugar packets, and creamer (may include some additional items) appear on your desk, you should aim to gift this coffee set to a fellow lab mate, but it must be a lab mate who is currently not at their lab desk. If they catch you coffeeing their desk, you are to keep your coffee set until you find another target to gift your coffee set. This is derived from RLE Coffee Hour, when Ameya requested that Besties in attendance of RLE Coffee Hour bring him back "something sweet". 

The retrieved "sweet" left on Ameya's desk was a singular packet of sugar.

Slowly, more coffee-related items began to add themselves to the sugar packet set, which are a creamer from another RLE Coffee Hour, a K-cup from the RLE 6th floor office in 36-647. Now, the coffee items travel as a unit from one Atomic Baddie to the next.

### Helmet of Lobby 7
See [Monday Prayer at 6](#monday-prayer-at-6). While the optimized distance from the student lab office to Prayer is outside, conditions are not ideal for traversal in the winter time. To avoid the not sexy weather, a path can be taken between 36-616 and Prayer via 36 → 34 → 38 → 39 → 37 → 35 → 33 → 9 → Lobby 7 → W11. Along this path is an advertisement of a biker whose helmet extrudes from the wall [image needed]. Passing by the helmet requires slapping it firmly.

### Monday Prayer at 6
When available, (a subset of) the Atomic Baddies go to W11 on Monday at 6pm to pray. This version of prayer involves sitting in the common area and consuming free food that is generously shared to MIT Vultures via Natalie Hill, who runs the Chapel Dinners.

### Potato-ing a desk 
A potato with [googly eyes](#googly-eyes) that traverses the desks of the Atomic Baddies in the same manner as [coffeeing](#coffeeing-a-desk). First appeared c. Fall 2022 during [Monday Prayer at 6](#monday-prayer-at-6), when Adriana snagged a rogue potato from the free farmers' stand in W11. Not knowing what to do with the potato after fellow Baddies refused to take it from her, she stuffed it in an unknowing YuQing's backpack side pocket, collapsing in an attempt to prevent oneself from peeing due to laughing too hard, in the middle of a time crosswalk-road intersection. The potato, like many other items in the lab, has earned googly eyes (and over IAP 2023, sprouts-- or "real eyes") and now visits un[sus](#sus)pecting Baddies.
