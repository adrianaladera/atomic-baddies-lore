The [Atomic Baddies](#atomic-baddie) have many layers (like an onion). You may not understand now, but if you wish to be enlightened, please continue reading. This doc compiles all our [traditions](#traditions), [motifs and mascots](#motifs-and-mascots), [vocabulary and nomenclature](vocabulary-and-nomenclature), and [glossary](#glossary). More serious acclimating to the lab things can be found in the [Lab Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lKayYaAPpht888L6OrTDPlhF_X8ZywD6t9jxhjNqkak/edit#heading=h.vbdyl0a6xx01), but this living document is where our culture lies.

We also have a [quoteboard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/134-kI5kwJ1K_Cm6tpQBIl3WjuJOdnRF7gtMPEhdOQmo/edit) to document all of our best lines throughout the years.

Current Atomic Baddies are [Ameya Daigavane](https://ameya98.github.io/), [Adriana Ladera](https://adrianaladera.github.io/), [Elyssa Hofgard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elyssa-hofgard12/), [Song Kim](https://songkim.me/), Tuong Phung, Yi-Lun Liao, and YuQing Xie.

# Traditions
### Coffeeing a Desk
If you see a set composed of coffee, sugar packets, and creamer (may include some additional items) appear on your desk, you should aim to gift this coffee set to a fellow lab mate, but it must be a lab mate who is currently not at their lab desk. If they catch you coffeeing their desk, you are to keep your coffee set until you find another target to gift your coffee set. This is derived from RLE Coffee Hour, when Ameya requested that Besties in attendance of RLE Coffee Hour bring him back "something sweet". 

The retrieved "sweet" left on Ameya's desk was a singular packet of sugar.

Slowly, more coffee-related items began to add themselves to the sugar packet set, which are a creamer from another RLE Coffee Hour, a K-cup from the RLE 6th floor office in 36-647. Now, the coffee items travel as a unit from one Atomic Baddie to the next.

### Helmet of Lobby 7
While the optimized distance from the student lab office to Prayer (*See [Monday Prayer at 6](#monday-prayer-at-6)*) is outside, conditions are not ideal for traversal in the winter time. To avoid the not sexy weather, a path can be taken between 36-616 and Prayer via 36 â†’ 34 â†’ 38 â†’ 39 â†’ 37 â†’ 35 â†’ 33 â†’ 9 â†’ Lobby 7 â†’ W11. Along this path is an advertisement of a biker whose helmet extrudes from the wall [image needed], located in Lobby 7. Passing by the helmet requires slapping it firmly.

### Monday Prayer at 6
When available, (a subset of) the Atomic Baddies go to W11 on Monday at 6pm to pray. This version of prayer involves sitting in the common area and consuming free food that is generously shared to MIT Vultures via Natalie Hill, who runs the Chapel Prayer Dinners.

### Muffin Monday
CSAIL (which we are totally a part of :D) hosts Muffin Mondays on the 9th floor common of Gates Tower of Stata. All sorts of researchers and hungry students wait in a long line for Flour goodies each Monday at 5.

### Taco Tuesday
Ayuda me estoy evaporando

### Potatoing a desk 
A potato with [googly eyes](#googly-eyes) that traverses the desks of the Atomic Baddies in the same manner as [coffeeing](#coffeeing-a-desk). First appeared c. Fall 2022 during [Monday Prayer at 6](#monday-prayer-at-6), when Adriana snagged a rogue potato from the free farmers' stand in W11. Not knowing what to do with the potato after fellow Baddies refused to take it from her, she stuffed it in an unknowing YuQing's backpack side pocket, collapsing in an attempt to prevent oneself from peeing due to laughing too hard, in the middle of a time crosswalk-road intersection. The potato, like many other items in the lab, has earned googly eyes (and over IAP 2023, sprouts-- or "real eyes") and now visits un[sus](#sus)pecting Baddies.

# Motifs and Mascots
### Eggs
Every student in the lab gets an egg, in some shape or form. Newer students are granted an egg by the Egg Madame, Adriana.
### Ducks
Quack or crack ðŸ‘€
### Googly Eyes
If you feel like you're being watched in the lab even when no one else is there, it's because you are. The lab features many [googly eyes](https://github.com/adrianaladera/atomic-baddies-lore/blob/main/static/googly-eyes.JPG), appearing in either pairs on various items throughout the lab, or in clusters. Aimed to personify inanimate objects.
### Hairy Ball Theorem Dog
No explanation. [Only picture](https://github.com/adrianaladera/atomic-baddies-lore/blob/main/static/hariy-ball-dog.webp).
### Notorious Meme Art
Self-explanatory. [Memes](https://github.com/adrianaladera/atomic-baddies-lore/blob/main/static/meme-walls.jpg).
### Spherical Harmonic Cows
Think of your regular spherical harmonics, but they moo. 

### Tess Bear (formerly, Bosco)
An entity that is often seen seated in unoccupied lab chairs in the student office. Tess Bear sports a blond wig, funky silver dangling earrings, an Atomic Architects shirt, and a dress, although the dress frequently rolls up due to Tess Bear being too thicc. First appeared as Bosco, brought in by Tuong, who adopted the bear from his other friend group. The idea of Tess Bear was birthed upon Tuong's suggestion that Bosco become our Tess [DUPE](#dupe), and was quickly fulfilled. Tess Bear is the Furrier transform of Tess.

# Vocabulary and Nomenclature
### Atomic Baddie
If you are a member of Tess' Atomic Architects research group and you are reading this, you are one ;)
### Dupe (emphasis on the "OO" pronunciation)
A smaller, less expensive, or lesser known version of a more well-known counterpart. The dupe could also be lesser in other areas that may be negative (e.g. Boston has less rats than New York, so Boston is a New York [DUPE](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRsccGA1/)).

### Bonk
The number of inappropriate jokes made within Bonk Master Song's presence, which warrant a bonk on the head given by her set of inflatable bats. Current bonk tally:
- Ameya: 7
- Adriana: 99
- YuQing: 3
- Tuong: 1
- Elyssa: 1
- Song: 1
### Bruh
### F
### Peanuts
According to Mario (via Song and Adriana), peanuts is something you say when something should be minor to do.
### Pog
### Sus
Bro kinda [sus](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/stable/api/math/math.html?highlight=Unit%20step#e3nn.math.soft_unit_step)
### Rizz
Your ability to attract people (usually romantically). Colloquially known as your ability to "pull" or have "hella game". W rizz denotes *hella game*, whereas L rizz signifies *little to no game*.
### Slay
Unlike the [bonk](#bonk) counter, there is no limit to how many times you can say the word slay, although Adriana often tests those limits. This is a one word comment usually said in response to something, event, or person that is positive or impressive. Can also be used as a verb. Examples:
- A Baddie just finished their group meeting presentation. "
