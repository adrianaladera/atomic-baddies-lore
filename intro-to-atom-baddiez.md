# Traditions
**Coffee-ing a Desk** - 
If you see a set composed of coffee, sugar packets, and creamer (may include some additional items) appear on your desk, you should aim to gift this coffee set to a fellow lab mate, but it must be a lab mate who is currently not at their lab desk. If they catch you coffeeing their desk, you are to keep your coffee set until you find another target to gift your coffee set. This is derived from RLE Coffee Hour, when Ameya requested that Besties in attendance of RLE Coffee Hour bring him back "something sweet". 

The retrieved "sweet" left on Ameya's desk was a singular packet of sugar.

Slowly, more coffee-related items began to add themselves to the sugar packet set, which are a creamer from another RLE Coffee Hour, a K-cup from the RLE 6th floor office in 36-647. Now, the coffee items travel as a unit from one Atomic Baddie to the next.

**Helmet of Lobby 7** - *See [Monday Prayer at 6](#monday-prayer-at-6)*. While the optimized distance from the student lab office to Prayer is outside, conditions are not ideal for traversal in the winter time. To avoid the not sexy weather, a path can be taken between 36-616 and Prayer via 36 → 34 → 38 → 39 → 37 → 35 → 33 → 9 → Lobby 7 → W11. Along this path is an advertisement of a helmet  [image needed]

**Potato-ing a desk** - A potato that traverses desks in the same manner as the coffee set.
